Thank you for your interest in TotalCross. If you don’t know where to start, here’s a quick overview
of the platform:
Supported Platforms
- Android 2.3.3 and above (API level 10).
- iOS 5.0 and above.
- Windows XP and above.
- Linux 32 bits (we only assure that it works on Debian distribution).
- Browser as Java applet (JDK 1.1 and above). Note that in this case you must enable some permission so that you can use files and, consequently, Litebase.
- Java SE.
- Windows Phone 8

TotalCross applications are developed almost exactly like Java applications, so anyone familiar with
Java should be able to start small TotalCross applications in a few minutes.

For an comprehensive reference, see the TotalCross Companion in the SDK 
or the Javadoc at http://doc.totalcross.com
