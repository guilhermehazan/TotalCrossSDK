. optimized RETokenizer.split that was using recursion to avoid using an array. The array is 10% faster than recursion. Also, now String4D checks if the argument passed in the split is a regex and if not, use Convert.tokenizeString, which is 5 times faster<br>
. fixed crash that will occur if a method is called recursively and trigger a call stack increase. (changed the pointer to a difference because when the call stack reaches the limit, it will not change all pointers since this method is called recursively)<br>

. fixed ListContainer.ITEM_SELECTED_EVENT not being sent to the listener.<br>
. now we ensure that, if the tcz is splitted, the main class is stored in the first tcz.<br>
<h1>build 2470</h1>
. now we store the appSettings stuff in files in win32. Windows 8 blocks any write to the HKLM registry, so we were unable to use it in such OS<br>
. included new gif files in tc.jar<br>
. trying to prevent OutOfMemory errors halting the VM when drawing listboxes<br>
. added Bar.addControl/addButton(Control c, boolean atRight); removed buttonAlign. fixed title not respecting the fore and back colors<br>

. now Vm.sleep tells Windows that we are not dead for any value for millis, and not just when millis = 1<br>
. added File.read() to read its contents<br>
. now tc.Deploy automatically increments a build number that can be retrieved using Settings.appBuildNumber(). Just create a file named tcapp.prop at a parent folder from where you call tc.Deploy. This file will be filled with the build.number; you may also add other info to this file, which can be later retrieved using Settings.appProps.<br>
. changed the internal spinners (ANDROID and IPHONE) to gif animated ones. added a new SYNC spinner. improved the Spinner sample. improved the Spinner javadocs explaining how to generate new ones.<br>
. improved Camera's javadocs showing how to use the external camera.<br>
. If you turn on automatic build number increment (with appProps) and the appVersion ends with a dot, during deploy the build number will be appended to the appVersion. For example, if appVersion is "2." and the current build number is 103, deploy will change the appVersion to "2.103" during deploy. To see the version that will appear, use at your application's constructo: <code>Settings.appVersion += Settings.appBuildNumber();</code><br>

* now Control.enabled is private. Use isEnabled to query the value; for extension Controls that access the enabled field, use Control.internalSetEnabled. Added keepDisabled to override the enabled state. This is useful if you want to keep a control disabled in a TabbedContainer while enabling/disabling the rest of the controls<br>
. fixed /p not working for wince<br>
. fixed crash in ios that causes SAV to abort the thread after synchronizing the photos<br>
. fixed problem in tc.Deploy when the path comes with spaces<br>

. added Control.safeUpdateScreen, which is thread-safe. changed all calls to updateScreen in the API to use the new method<br>
. fixed infinite recursion at MultiListBox<br>

. now tc.jar includes tcfont.tcz<br>
. fixed npe; geolocator may be null at gpsclose.<br>
. fixed SQLiteUtil not correctly returning the date or datetime values on getStrings. SQLite has a problem (not sure if its a bug) where it returns DATE for both DATE and DATETIME types, so this method returns the correct correspondence: DATE for date and TIME for DATETIME (remember that in TotalCross, a Time object also contains the date).<br>
. updated desktop's FontGenerator to use the new 8bpp antialiase and also the correct default sizes.<br>
